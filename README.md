# Takeaway project

A takeaway ordering service with the confirmation sent to your mobile phone number.

--------------------

This a Makers weekend challenge from week 2 with the following user stories: 

As a customer<br>
So that I can check if I want to order something<br>
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.

As a customer<br>
So that I can order the meal I want<br>
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

As a customer<br>
So that I can verify that my order is correct<br>
I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

Use the `twilio-ruby` gem to implement this next one. You will need to use doubles too.

As a customer<br>
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time<br>
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.
